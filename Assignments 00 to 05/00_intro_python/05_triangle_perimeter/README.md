# **🔺 05_triangle_perimeter – Calculate Triangle Perimeter 📏**  

## **📌 Overview**  
This Python script calculates the **perimeter of a triangle** based on user-inputted side lengths. 📐✨  

## **🖥️ Code Explanation**  
- **📥 Takes input** from the user for the three sides of a triangle.  
- **➕ Computes the perimeter** by adding all three sides.  
- **🖨️ Displays the result** using an f-string for better readability.  

## **🚀 How to Run**  
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.  
2. Navigate to the script directory:  
   ```bash
   cd Project-4-Assignments/Assignments 00 to 05/00_intro_python/05_triangle_perimeter/
   ```  
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  
4. Enter the three side lengths when prompted. The script will then **calculate and display the triangle's perimeter.** ✅🎉  

This exercise reinforces **basic arithmetic, user input handling, and formatted output** in Python! 🚀📊
